

Task 1
In this program I am reading a file called sample.txt.  
If the file is present then the program will print all the lines.  
If the file is not there then it will show an error message using try and except.

File name: task1_read_file.py

Task 2
This program asks the user to enter some data and writes it to output.txt.  
After that I am also appending extra text to the same file.  
At the end the program reads the file and prints the final content.
